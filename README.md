## MIT Libraries Code Club

### Hi and welcome!

This site uses a git repository hosted on GitHub to automatically generate the
html from markdown files. We'd love if members edited and created files on this
site to both help the club maintain documentation as well as to practice using
git and GitHub!

Some [initial documentation](docs/editing_pages.md) on how to edit pages is
available, but please do add and update it to make it more useful to all of us!

### Join the Club

As practice using git and GitHub, please add your name to the list of
[Code Club Members](exercises/add-your-name/names.md).
